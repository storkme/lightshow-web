# angular-typescript-webpack-starter

* Angular 2
* Webpack 2
* Typescript 2

don't forget ng2 has a style guide: https://angular.io/styleguide

## files n' folders

* `src/` source files (html, js, etc)
* `build/` intermediate source files (generated by the ng compiler) live here.
* `dist/` compiled source files (e.g. what you will deploy) live here

## Scripts

* `cleanup` - delete dist & build folders
* `explorer` - run `source-map-explorer` (great for figuring out why your main.bundle.js is like 11MB)
* `ngc` - run the angular compiler
* `build` - build the app with AoT compilation
* `build:jit` - build the app in the conventional way (using JIT compilation)
* `serve-watch:jit` - serve the plain JIT version of the site.
* `serve-watch:aot` - serve an AoT compiled version of the site (can be a little buggy - probably best to use `serve:jit` instead)
* `serve:dist` - run a mini web server locally on port 9001 and serve the contents of the dist/ folder.

## TODO

* Some kind of css preprocessor - maybe scss??
* Maybe testing?

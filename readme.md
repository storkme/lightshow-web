# angular-typescript-webpack-starter

* Angular 2
* Webpack 2
* Typescript 2
* Unit testing with Karma and Jasmine

## Get started

1. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

  ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```

2. Run the `serve-watch:jit` script to kick off the dev server.

  ```npm run serve-watch:jit```
  
3. Open up [http://localhost:9000/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:9000/webpack-dev-server/) in the browser.

## files n' folders

* `src/` source files (html, js, etc)
* `build/` intermediate source files (generated by the ng compiler) live here.
* `dist/` compiled source files (e.g. what you will deploy) live here

## Scripts

In order of how likely you are to need them....!

1. `serve-watch:jit` - serve the plain JIT version of the site.
2. `build` - build the app with AoT compilation
3. `cleanup` - delete dist & build folders
6. `serve:dist` - run a mini web server locally on port 9001 and serve the contents of the dist/ folder. Useful for testing your built code.
4. `explorer` - run `source-map-explorer` (great for figuring out why your main.bundle.js is like 11MB)
5. `build:jit` - build the app in the conventional way (using JIT compilation). You might want to do this if the regular, AoT build is failing.
7. `serve-watch:aot` - serve an AoT compiled version of the site *(can be a little buggy - probably best to use `serve:jit` instead)*

## TODO

* Test watching....
